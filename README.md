# FaultLine
Faultline tracks prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi to find where they break. It detects when two markets pricing the same event disagree — and tells you if that's a real opportunity or a structural trap. Built for traders, researchers, and anyone who wants to know if the odds they're reading can actually be trusted.
