# FaultLine
Faultline tracks prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi to find where they break. It detects when two markets pricing the same event disagree — and tells you if that's a real opportunity or a structural trap. Built for traders, researchers, and anyone who wants to know if the odds they're reading can actually be trusted.

**Overview**

Prediction markets let people bet on real-world events — elections, Fed decisions, sports outcomes. Platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi show probability odds for these events, and millions of dollars move based on those numbers.

But here's the problem nobody talks about: these platforms don't always agree. And when they disagree, most people assume it's a profit opportunity. Sometimes it is. Often, it's a trap.

Faultline is a tool that tells you the difference.

It monitors prediction markets across platforms in real time, detects price gaps, and explains exactly why they exist. Is it because one market has low trading volume and thin liquidity? Is it because news just broke and one platform hasn't caught up yet? Or — most dangerously — is it because the two platforms will actually resolve the same event differently, meaning what looks like free money could cost you on both sides?

Faultline classifies every gap, scores the structural risk behind it, tracks how accurate each market category has historically been, and archives every case where platforms have resolved the same event with different outcomes.

It doesn't just show you what the markets say. It tells you whether to believe them.
